# COVID-19 in Baden-Württemberg time series [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/probonopd/covid19.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/probonopd/covid19)

Get number of Corona infections per Landkreis in Baden-Württemberg
from Schwäbische Zeitung and output it as CSV since I could not find it in machine-readable form.

It may be interesting to compare those numbers
over time with the figures from sozialministerium.baden-wuerttemberg.de
